## Backend
### Configuration
All of the configuration files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Config).
Define and configure beans and settings for a specific component or functionality within a Java application, such as managing dependencies, defining endpoints, or setting up filters like CORS.

### Controller
All of the controller files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Controller).
Endpoint handler that processes incoming requests, interacts with the application's business logic, and prepares a response to send back to the client.

### Data Transfer Object (DTO)
All of the DTO files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/DTO).
DTOs are used to transfer structured data between different layers or subsystems of an application, improving efficiency, security, and compatibility.

### Exception Handling
All of the exception handling files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Exception).
Manage and process unexpected errors or exceptional situations that occur during program execution, providing mechanisms to gracefully handle and communicate errors to users or other parts of the application.

### Model
All of the model files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Model).
Structured data entity or object that encapsulates attributes, behaviors, and relationships, typically used to interact with a database or to transfer data between different parts of an application.

### Repository
All of the repository files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Repository).
Encapsulates the logic for accessing and manipulating data from a persistent storage, such as a database, using methods that align with the application's data model and business requirements.

### Service
All of the service files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Service).
Encapsulates business logic and application-specific functionality, providing reusable methods that orchestrate tasks and operations across multiple components or layers within an application.

All of the service implementation file can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Service/Implementation).
Contains the actual implementation of business logic and functionality defined in a service interface, handling specific tasks and operations within an application.

### Utility
All of the utility files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Backend/src/main/java/com/example/Xcrack/Utility).
Used to group together related functions or methods that perform common tasks, promoting code organization, reusability, and maintainability within an application.

## Frontend
All of the frontend related files can be found [here](https://github.com/wmh004/Xcrack/tree/main/Frontend).
